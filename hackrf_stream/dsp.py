    how many readings there are to get lucky in and on how many frames were
    reduced into each one. One frame of bin noise wobbles by about 6 dB from
    its median to its 16th percentile; the peak of 25 frames wobbles by 1.3,

    A level set at a fixed multiple of that spread is therefore wrong by tens

    times the bins in the band, and it does not matter which — and that number
