"""Fast spectra from a HackRF held on one frequency.

hackrf_sweep is limited by retuning to about 405 tuning steps a second. Staying
on one tune instead removes that limit and uses the whole 20 MSPS stream, which
is worth roughly 1500 averaged spectra a second over a 20 MHz band.

    from hackrf_stream import SpectrumSource

    def show(frequencies, powers_db, timestamp):
        print(powers_db.max())

    with SpectrumSource(center_freq=128e6, bin_size=40e3) as source:
        source.start(show)
        ...
        source.stop()

Requires libhackrf, the same system library hackrf_sweep uses. Nothing here
bundles it.
